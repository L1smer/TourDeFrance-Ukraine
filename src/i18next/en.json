      "Some people had to leave their homes, businesses, and lives. Others couldn't leave due to health or other circumstances and are still living in danger, shelling, and fear.",
      "My life has been connected to cycling for 23 years. I'm a Master of Sports of Ukraine. I decided to use my strength and experience to help those in need. In 2025, I plan to ride the entire Tour de France route — one day ahead of the pros.",
      "The route consists of 21 stages, 3320 km of distance, and 51,550 m of elevation gain. At 56, it will be my biggest challenge.",

      "In 2024, I completed the 'Tour de France Ukraine' by replicating all stages within our country. Now — France: 11 regions, 34 departments, and the Col de la Loze pass (2304 m), the highest point of the 2025 Tour.",
      "I’ll be accompanied by a support vehicle — with food, water, and mechanical help.The driver will be a Ukrainian, a native of Dnipro, a master of sports in cycling, motocross and motorsport - Volodymyr Okorokov.",
